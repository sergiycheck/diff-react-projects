# Hookstate Sample Application

This is an example application, which uses the core library of [Hookstate](https://github.com/avkonst/hookstate) to manage various types of states.

This project can be used as a 'starter repo'.
The source code demonstrates the usage of Hookstate in more realistic, large application than shorter [code samples and demos available online](https://hookstate.js.org/).
We advise you to look through the shorter samples online, if you discovered the Hookstate for the first time, before studying this application.

[See this application running online](https://hookstate.js.org/demo-todolist/)
